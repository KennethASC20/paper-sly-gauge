        Why Did I Make This Site?
      </h2>
      <p class="project">
        This site first started off as just a joke to a couple of friends, until they actually liked the idea and supported me on it. Next thing you know, I'm at home googling dating websites for people spending their last few days on Earth and to my avail nothing came up. I never really thought my ideas would look great on the big screen, or my computer screen. And Who knows what'll happen, maybe a rich investor would like my idea and make me rich, kind of like Jeff Bezos, except for the baldness.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What Is This Site?
      </h2>
      <p class="project">
        Die2Gether is a dating website dedicated to those who are elderly and still looking for a significant other to be a companion to. We all know that at a young age, love can be a hard thing to obtain but not when you're in youre mid 50's. This site is still in development and being worked on around the clock to bring satisfying features that will hopefully bring a more settling atmosphere.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Where Can You Access This Site?
      </h2>
      <p class="project">
        Currently, this site can only be access through the web. It's very compatible with Chrome and Internet Explorer, but be cautious about other third party browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Opera, etc. Hopefully in the future, Die2Gether will become an app software to the public and be used world wide.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How Did I Make This Site?
      </h2>
      <p class="project">
        I made the foundations of this site using an in browser coding application known as <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank">Glitch</a>. I also used another website called <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to assist me in forming a suitable UI for those on mobile devices. I have learned these techniques from my educator <a href="https://github.com/berryny" target="_blank">Judi</a> who is very familiar with these languages.
